# Project Plan

## General

- [x] find and save the script for making the benchmarks more deterministic
- [x] write the documentation for the script
- [x] test the script and provide some examples
- [x] create a script that runs the benchmark by name (i.e. it builds the binary and runs the benchmark)
- [ ] the script is built for Intel CPUs, add support for other CPUs, I have an AMD one so try to adjust it

## CRC32C Implementation

- [x] Write simplest failing test for CRC32C calculation
- [x] Implement minimum code to make CRC32C test pass
- [x] Add test for empty input
- [x] Add test for known CRC32C values
