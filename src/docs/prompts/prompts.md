# All Prompts

## WAL Implementation Analysis
```
Id' like to start to implement the wal module but first ? I'd like to evaluate the wal file format. I need a version field in order to be able to do some non retrocompatibile modifications and handling different versions with different code. Another criterion is resilience, I'd like to know if some of my data are corrupt. This is a wal module specifically designed for key/value storage and the correspondin operation, so if there are some specific implementations that makes the job easier o more robust or faster I'd like fo follow them. What are the options available? please analyzte them thoroughly
```

## Documentation Request
```
can you save all the prompts I gave in the dir src/docs/prompts?
```

```
No I'd like to have all the prompts (no distinction per module) in a single file called prompts.md
```

```
please do not inclide the cd commands in the file
```

## WAL Record Format Question
```
In tne record format you proposed there are three different lengths field, are they really necessary? I think including only key and value len fields is enough or am I missing something?
```

## WAL Sequence Field Question
```
what is the goal of the sequence field?
```

## WAL Concurrent Writing Question
```
can be a wal file being written concurrently? I was supposing that a WAL is being written by a single thread an always sequentially. What are the known scenarios where a WAL file is written concurrently without synchonization?
```

## WAL Sequence Field Necessity Question
```
So, if a single WAL is written sequentially do I really need the sequence field? If yes why?
```

## WAL Sequence Field References Question
```
you wrote that the sequence field is a standard in many WAL implementation. can you give me some references?
```

## WAL Documentation Update Request
```
Ok, can you update the CLAUDE.md with the record format and document the decision?
```

## CRC Field Algorithm Details Request
```
I'd like to add some details for CRC field. Are there any algorithms for checking data integrity that balance speed and consistency? I'm looking for ones that are easy to implement using SIMD instructions (I don't wnat to the use SIMD operation explicityl but relying on autovectorization)
```

## CLAUDE.md Update Policy Request
```
Please update CLAUDE.md only when I tell you explicitly
```

## Hardware-Specific Algorithm Question
```
If the code of this project will runo only on modern Intel/AMD CPU what is the best algorithm? please rememeber that on of the goal is to minimize extrnal dependencies so it' very likey that I'll implement the CRC directly
```

## CLAUDE.md Update Request
```
please update CLAUDE.MD with the last decision
```

## CRC32C Table Implementation Request
```
please add a new implmentation of crc32c in the corresponding file. the new implementation is a table based one and must process one byte a time instead of one bit at a time. Write the tests using the same data for the current implementation.
```

## CRC32C Table Benchmark Request
```
now please add a benchmark for the new table based implementation
```

## CRC32C Code Refactoring Request
```
can you refactor the new crc32c code and define only one the polynomial and extract the crc32_table variable out of the crc32c_table method?
```

## CRC32C Comment Format Question
```
why did you proposed the change to the comment in the file?
```

## CRC32C Idiomatic Rust Question
```
is it possible to write the generate_crc32_table in more idiomatic rust avoiding the while?
```

## Main.md Review Request
```
please review the mian.dm file and look for typos or syntax errors or unnatural english expressions
```

## Commit Changes Request
```
please commit all the changes
```

## runperf Script CPU Flexibility Request
```
the script runperf is built for Intel CPU is it possible to make it more flexible adding support for AMD CPUs? if yes please do it in a way theat supports all types of CPU DO NOT delete the current intel cpu support
```

## runperf Script Test Confirmation
```
it works, thanks
```

## CLAUDE.md Reading Confirmation Question
```
did you read the claude.md file before starting this session?
```

## Prompt Saving Question
```
did you save the prompts I gave you?
```

## CRC32C 8-byte Processing Implementation Request
```
the next step is to create a new function that computes crc32c but the implementation must be able to process 8 bytes at a time using more than one table. the function interface is the same of the other one and also the tests are the same
```

## CRC32C Slice8 Refactoring Request
```
I'd like to refactor crc32c_slice8, I'd like to process the data using the chunk function available from slice. the logic is always the same
```

## CRC32C Slice8 Inline Refactoring Request
```
the next fractor to the same method is ot inline the content of crc_bytes using crc directly and decomposing chink in bytes as you did for crc_bytes
```

## Commit Changes Request
```
please commit the changes
