### Project Goals

There are several goals for this project:

### Functional Goals

- Create a 100% rust based key value store (non-external dependencies using other languages i.e. rocks db) 
- fewer external dependencies as possible
- optimized for values of size < ~ 16kb
- with the same performance of rocks db (this is actually more a wish than a goal)

### Personal Goals

- Learn some data structures and algorithms (WAL, Skip list for memtable, Bloom filter, etc.)
- Build the codebase with TDD
- Use claude code as AI assistant
